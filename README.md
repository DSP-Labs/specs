# DSP specs
> This repository contains the specs for the DSP Protocol and associated subsystems.

## Spec badges and lifecycle

We use the following label system to identify the state of each spec:

- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-wip-orange.svg?style=flat-square) - A work-in-progress, possibly to describe an idea before actually committing to a full draft of the spec.
- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-draft-yellow.svg?style=flat-square) - A draft that is ready to review. It should be implementable.
- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-reliable-green.svg?style=flat-square) - A spec that has been adopted (implemented) and can be used as a reference point to learn how the system works.
- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-stable-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square) - We consider this spec to close to final, it might be improved but the system it specifies should not change fundamentally.
- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-permanent-blue.svg?style=flat-square) - This spec will not change.
- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-deprecated-red.svg?style=flat-square) - This spec is no longer in use.

**The DSP protocol stack is under development and all specs are still `draft`**
